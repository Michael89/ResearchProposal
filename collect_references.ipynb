These interactions are\\nmonitored by a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to anticipate editing\\nintentions in real time, bypassing the need for explicit prompt entry. Finally,\\nwe apply a powerful diffusion prior, enhanced by a carefully learned two-branch\\nplug-in module, to process editing requests with precise control.

We investigate this question and find that the features and\\nrepresentations learned during pre-training are not essential. Surprisingly,\\nusing only the attention patterns from pre-training (i.e., guiding how\\ninformation flows between tokens) is sufficient for models to learn high\\nquality features from scratch and achieve comparable downstream performance. We\\nshow this by introducing a simple method called attention transfer, where only\\nthe attention patterns from a pre-trained teacher ViT are transferred to a\\nstudent, either by copying or distilling the attention maps. Since attention\\ntransfer lets the student learn its own features, ensembling it with a\\nfine-tuned teacher also further improves accuracy on ImageNet. We\\nsystematically study various aspects of our findings on the sufficiency of\\nattention maps, including distribution shift settings where they underperform\\nfine-tuning. We hope our exploration provides a better understanding of what\\npre-training accomplishes and leads to a useful alternative to the standard\\npractice of fine-tuning',\n",
